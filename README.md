## The Problem

As described in Christoph Kern's "[Securing the Tangled Web](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub42934.html)",
Google has been fairly successful at combating DOM-based XSS attacks by relying on a set of
[typed objects](https://github.com/google/safe-html-types/blob/master/doc/index.md) instead of
strings to represent HTML snippets, URLs, etc. Compilation-time analysis done for JavaScript code 
ensures that only these types can be used with various DOM APIs that can be used as DOM-based XSS 
sinks (`el.innerHTML`, `location.href`, `ScriptElement.src` and so on). These types do not obliterate 
DOM XSS in themselves, as authors may still create an instance of a type with an untrusted value. 
Instead, it simplifies the security analysis of the application - security reviewers don't need to 
deeply understand and review each and every usage of a given *sink*, but can instead focus their 
efforts on the code that *generates* the typed objects. As long as these "trusted" types are always 
generated by safe templating libraries, sanitizers, constants, and so on, developers can have a high 
degree of confidence that the risk of DOM-based XSS remains low.

Google's internal implementation has a number of bells and whistles (and makes a number of
assumptions about requirements) that probably aren't suitable for the world at large. It would be
interesting to explore how we might extract some more generic version of this concept from those
internal tools in order to bring this kind of functionality to the web in a generic fashion.
For example, different applications might have different opinions about what makes a particular
HTML snippet "safe", but regardless of the definition, it seems clear that the browser is
well-positioned to enforce type constraints dynamically at runtime. That would be a substantial
improvement over the tight link between the type system and the compiler.

## A Possible Approach

While we could jam all sorts of sanitization functionality into such a system, it seems reasonable
to start small until we know how existing templating systems and sanitizers will layer any
primitives we introduce into their existing systems. The following three-pronged approach seems
compelling as a first step:

1.  Introduce a number of types that correspond to the XSS sinks we wish to protect. For example,
    we could define a `TrustedHTML` object that would automatically escape interesting characters,
    making it suitable for injection via `innerHTML`.

    These types should be pretty minimal in nature, making them polyfillable in browsers that don't
    support them natively.

2.  Enumerate all the XSS sinks we wish to protect, and overload each of them with a variant that
    accepts a safe type. For example, `Element.innerHTML`'s setter could accept `(DOMString or TrustedHTML)`,
    and we could overload `document.write(DOMString)` with `document.write(TrustedHTML)`.

    As above, this mechanism should be polyfillable; the polyfilled types could define stringifiers
    which would enable them to be automatically cast into strings when called on existing setters.

3.  Introduce a mechanism for disabling the raw string version of each of the sinks identified
    above. For example, something like a theoretical `Content-Security-Policy: require-trusted-types`
    header could cause the `innerHTML` setter to throw a `TypeError` if a raw string was passed in.

    This is a little more difficult to polyfill, but should be possible for many (all?) setters and
    methods that aren't marked as [`[Unforgeable]`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#Unforgeable).

### Trusted Types

*   **TrustedHTML**: This type would be used to represent a trusted snippet that could be passed
    into an HTML context.

    ```
    interface TrustedHTML {
      static TrustedHTML escape(DOMString html);
      static TrustedHTML unsafelyCreate(DOMString html);

      stringifier;
    }
    ```
    
    *   The static `escape` method would produce a `TrustedHTML` object that neutered the string
        provided by entity-encoding all instances of `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'`.

    *   The static `unsafelyCreate` method would produce a `TrustedHTML` object that accepted the
        provided string as-is.

*   **TrustedURL**: This type would be used to represent a trusted URL that could be used to load
    non-scripting resources or navigate a frame.

    ```
    interface TrustedURL {
      static TrustedURL sanitize(DOMString url);
      static TrustedURL unsafelyCreate(DOMString url);

      stringifier;
    }
    ```

    *   The static `sanitize` method would produce a `TrustedURL` object that would resolve the
        given string against the document's base URL, and ensure that result was a valid URL, and
        that it had an `http` or `https` scheme (blocking things like `javascript:` or external
        protocol handlers). String that didn't make the cut would be replaced with `about:invalid`.

    *   The static `unsafelyCreate` method would produce a `TrustedURL` object that accepted the
        provided string as-is, producing a URL by resolving the given string against the document's
        base URL.
        
*   **TrustedScriptURL**: This type would be used to represent a URL that could be used to load 
    resources that may result in script execution in the current document.
  
    ```
    interface TrustedScriptURL {
      static TrustedScriptURL unsafelyCreate(DOMString url);
      
      stringifier;
    }
    ```  
    
    *   The static `unsafelyCreate` method would produce a `TrustedScriptURL` object that accepted 
        the provided string as-is, producing a URL by resolving the given string against the 
        document's base URL.

*   **TrustedJavascript**: This type would be used to represent a trusted JavaScript code block i.e. something that is trusted by the author to be executed by adding it to a `<script>` element content or passing to an `eval` function.

### DOM Sinks

*   **HTML Contexts**: Given something like `typedef (DOMString or TrustedHTML) HTMLString`, we'd
    poke at a number of methods and attribute setters to accept the new type:

    ```
    partial interface Element {
        attribute HTMLString innerHTML;
        attribute HTMLString outerHTML;
        void insertAdjacentHTML(DOMString position, HTMLString text);
    };
    ```

    ```
    partial interface Document {
        void write(HTMLString text);
        void writeln(HTMLString text);
    };
    ```

    ```
    partial interface DOMParser {
        Document parseFromString(HTMLString str, SupportedType type);
    };
    ```

    ```
    partial interface Range {
        DocumentFragment createContextualFragment(HTMLString fragment);
    };
    ```

    ```
    partial interface HTMLIFrameElement {
         DOMString srcdoc;
    };
    ```

*   **URL Contexts**: Given something like `typedef (USVString or TrustedURL) URLString`, we'd poke
    at a number of methods and attribute setters to accept the new type:

    ```
    partial interface Location {
        stringifier attribute URLString href;
        void assign(URLString url);
        void replace(URLString url);

        // (These aren't `URLString`, but they should be something)
        DOMString pathname;
        DOMString search;
    };
    ```

    ```
    // A few element types go here. `HTMLBaseElement`, `HTMLLinkElement` 
    // `HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils` from a quick skim through HTML.
    partial interface HTMLXXXElement : HTMLElement {
        attribute URLString href;
    };
    ```                                                                                                                            

    ```
    // A few element types go here. `HTMLSourceElement`, `HTMLImageElement`,
    // `HTMLIFrameElement`, `HTMLTrackElement`, `HTMLMediaElement`, 
    // `HTMLInputElement`,  `HTMLFrameElement`
    // from a quick skim through HTML.
    //
    // The same applies to their SVG variants.
    partial interface HTMLXXXElement : HTMLElement {
        attribute URLString src;
        attribute URLString srcset; // Only `HTMLSourceElement` and `HTMLImageElement`
    };
    ```

    ```
    partial interface HTMLObjectElement : HTMLElement {
        attribute URLString data;
        attribute URLString codebase;
    };
    ```
    ```
    partial interface Document {
        attribute URLString location;
    };
    ```

    ```
    partial interface Window {
        attribute URLString location;
        void open(URLString location);
    };
    ```
    
* **Script URL Context**: Given something like `typedef (USVString or TrustedScriptURL) ScriptURLString`, 
    we'd poke at a number of methods and attribute setters to accept the new type:
    
    ```
    partial interface WorkerGlobalScope {
        void importScripts(ScriptURLString... urls);
    };
    ```

    ```
    // A few element types go here. `HTMLEmbedElement`, `HTMLScriptElement`
    // from a quick skim through HTML.
    //
    // The same applies to their SVG variants.
    partial interface HTMLXXXElement : HTMLElement {
        attribute ScriptURLString src;
    };
    ```

    TODO(slekies) - sinks enumeration.
    
*   **JavaScript Contexts**: Replace `DOMString` in the following with something
    reasonable.

    ```
    partial interface Window {
        void eval(DOMString code);
        void setTimeout(DOMString code, int timeout);
        void setInterval(DOMString code, int timeout);
    };
    ```

    ```
    partial interface HTMLScriptElement : HTMLElement {
        attribute DOMString innerText;
        attribute DOMString text;
        attribute DOMString textContent;
    };
    ```

## Open Questions

1.  Sebastian doesn't like `Content-Security-Policy`, so maybe we should spell the flag in #3 above
    differently. He proposed `Disable-Unsafe-APIs: True`.

2.  Artur and Koto suggest that we'll need something more granular than the global flag, however
    we spell it, in order to deal with piecemeal migrations.

3.  Define more types. Figure out how to treat `iframe.src`.

4.  Document more sinks.

## Polyfill

This repository contains a polyfill implementation. To build the polyfill (Java required):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mikewest/trusted-types/
$ cd trusted-types
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

To see the polyfill in action, visit the [demo page](demo/index.html) - either using the file:// protocol or a web server of your choice: 
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
# See http://127.0.0.1:8000/demo/index.html
```

It can be tested by running:
```
$ npm test
```
The polyfill can also be run against the [web platform test suite](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests), but that requires small patches to the suite - see [tests/platform-tests/platform-tests-runner.sh](tests/platform-tests/platform-tests-runner.sh).
